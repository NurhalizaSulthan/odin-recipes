       <h3>Descriptiom</h3>
       <p>This strawberry ice cream recipe uses egg yolks, cream, sugar, and fresh strawberries to make a fabulous frozen dessert.</p>

       <h3>Ingredients</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>1 quart fresh strawberries, hulled</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups heavy cream, divided</li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3 egg yolks</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons light corn syrup</li>
       </ul>

       <h3>Steps</h3>
       <ol>
        <li>Place strawberries into the container of a blender or food processor; puree until smooth. Pour into a large bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 1/4 cups of cream in a saucepan over medium heat until it begins to bubble at the edge of the pan. Whisk sugar, egg yolks, 
        remaining 1/4 cup cream, and corn syrup together in a large bowl. Gradually pour the hot cream into egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly. Return mixture to the saucepan and heat until thick enough to coat the back of a metal spoon, about 5 minutes. Do not allow the mixture to boil. Strain custard into berry puree through a sieve; mix well and refrigerate until chilled.</li>
        <li>Fill an ice cream maker with the mixture, and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions.</li>
